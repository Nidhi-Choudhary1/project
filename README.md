#JOB SCOUT project
The Job Scout project is designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). 
Using Python and Streamlit, the application analyzes resumes and compares them to job descriptions. 
It generates an ATS compatibility score based on how well the resume matches the job requirements. 
The tool leverages Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro AI model to provide actionable feedback, including keyword optimization, grammar improvements, and suggestions for enhancing work experience descriptions.
